# Dynamic-Programming-for-Optimal-Insulin-Basal-Rate-Management
This project implements and compares dynamic programming algorithms for optimizing insulin basal rates in diabetes management. The goal is to determine the optimal insulin pump delivery schedule that maintains blood glucose levels within a safe target range while minimizing hypoglycemia risk and pump rate fluctuations.
